        <p>Blockly Games is a series of educational games that teach programming.  It is
            designed for children who have not had prior experience with computer programming.
            By the end of these games, players are ready to use conventional text-based languages.</p>
            <p>Maze is an introduction to loops and conditionals. It starts simply, but every level is more challenging than the last.</p>
          
            <p>Blockly Games is a Google project to encourage tomorrow's programmers. The
            games are designed to be self-paced and self-teaching. Feel free to use Blockly
            Games both inside and outside the classroom. All code is open source, see
            the <a href="https://github.com/google/blockly-games/wiki">developer's&nbsp;website</a>
