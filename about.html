        <p>Blockly Par is a game inspired in Blockly-Games, that uses Blockly programming language
          to teach parallel thinking through a game.
          It has educational purposes, and was designed specially to freshman students in Computer Science
          majors. Is expected that at the end of the games the students feel challenged
          to explore parallelism in their programs</p>
        
        <p>This project was developed during as a Bachelor thesis in Computer Science at the Federal University
          of Santa Maria, in Brazil.
